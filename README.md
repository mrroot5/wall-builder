# Introduction

This program build a wall with python on your terminal.

# Requirements

- Python 3.6.7.
- Virtualenv (optional).

# How to use it?

You can import *builder* from wall package or use `main.py`.

Well, I assume that you try `main.py`. You can build your wall in two ways:

1. **Arguments:** First argument are number of rows and second is the number
of bricks per row. Example: `python3 main.py 5 5`.

2. **User input:** If you don't want, or simply forgive it, to use arguments,
then the program ask you for rows and bricks.

At the end, you will see an horizontal wall.
